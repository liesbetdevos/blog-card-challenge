This was a good exercise to freshen up my knowledge of the css box model. It was also good to practice a clear html structure. I also learned how negative margins work and how they can be used. For this challenge, I used them to make the horizontal line within the card span over the padding of the card.

### What I learned

* CSS box model
* Negative margins
* Line Spacing

### Useful resources
